    <p class="answers">The girls are putting on their faces in the bathroom while I’m crouching on the wooden floor and the afternoon sun starts raising floodlights on the space I used to call my bedroom. I causally chew on the wooden tip of my hand fan and check the time. We’re running behind, but it was to be expected: The girls are new to Alabama­­, let alone Birmingham­­, so finding their materials would have understandably taken a good chunk of time. This entire encounter is serendipitous, so there’s no point in harping on time. I spit out my fan and survey the room. The sight is aggressive yet soft as moonlight. The demanding Mattel pinks, sugaries blues, and checker patterns disorient the masculine memories of my own unfortunate childhood. Stuffed bodysuits are draped about in states of disjointed animation­­, sexless monsters of liminal joy that promise reclamation of identity with a cost of erasure from the human recognition and empathy. From atop the tea party set, an Optimus Prime mask slurs bassy complaints behind glittery pink duct tape. The assault calls to mind the work of Antonin Artaud, who demanded "communion between actor and audience in a magic exorcism; gestures, sounds, unusual scenery, and lighting combine to form a language, superior to words, that can be used to subvert thought and logic and to shock the spectator into seeing the baseness of his world." In this case, Teeny Montana and Pussybaby would be likened more to priestesses than actors, for the installation work carries more spiritual importance than a simple actor with a character performance. These two trans artists are bringing us into their own world, one where the princesses are always at play.</p>

    <p class="question">So did either of you have any type of training in 3D installation work before, or is this something you fell into?</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>T.M.</span> I studied 3D art when I was in college, but I dropped out really early. I dropped out when I was sixteen.I worked at this theater in asheville, sort of like a circus for the stage, so I’ve have been in costume, acrobatics, lighting, sound design. Nothing formal but, I lived in a community of artists­­everybody had their own specific talents, and I got to work with all of them on projects, and everyone was happy to work with me because they liked my ideas. I learned a lot from those people.</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>PB</span> My only training would have been in hair and cosmetology and barber practice. I never did anything but cut hair and paint usually.</p>
    <p class="question">What would you say are your current biggest influences?</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>PB</span> For a long time I’ve been in love with Mary Kate and Ashley. I feel like they have the whole twin aspect down.They have this whole lifestyle as twins that’s very successful. I’m also inspired by music…</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>T.M.</span> Yeah we don’t really listen to any male artists.</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>PB</span> Mostly women and women of color. Sisters of color. And of course instagram kids like hateboy2, princessgolem, princessnokia. Anything just like a little bit different than what you normally see on social media.</p>
    <p class="question">Earlier you said that one of the purposes of your installation art is to create a space that best synchronizes with your identity. Could you elaborate on that?</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>T.M.</span> Mmhmm. Synchronizes with my identity and I’ve found it’s the most appropriate means to bring someone into my world. My inner world is very idiosyncratic; my form of ritual and magic is very unique to me like with anyone else. I can’t explain it really. I’m really inspired by high fantasy­­ I have a LOTR tattoo on my chest you know. Weird worlds that help me create my own because I don’t have the formal training to display my world on a canvas or in a book. But I can go to a thrift store, get some princess dresses and shit, whip it together, and bam! That’s my lo­fi art. My art when I was in Asheville, my goal was to be very triggering, to remind people of the oppression they don’t wanna see. Racially and sexually charged.</p>
    <p class="question">Is that where that piece came from, involving one of the suits and the chains.</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>T.M.</span> That was straight ritual for me. That was at an event and it was considered an installation for a Day of the Dead event. The event was horrible, and one aspect of the performance was, “This is me as the artist­­ the latin person at this ridiculously appropriative Day of the Dead event.” Stuck and given the least resources, and I still pulled the hottest and craziest installation, and I was chained there for five hours just to prove a point. That was magic. Art is magic for me, first and foremost. It’s how my brain turns over. You know when you’re dreaming, your brain is processing all that has happened. I guess I don’t do enough in my dreams; I have to get it out in the real world. Art is the formulation of those things.</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>Me</span> Channeling, so to speak.</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>T.M.</span> Ohh totally, totally. Channeling is part of my ancestry.</p>
    <p class="question">Have you done any public installations that weren’t placed in a queer setting before?</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>T.M. </span>I had never done any installation in a queer space until Short Mountain and IDA. It wasn’t really my installation, so I don’t think it counts. I guess your bedroom counts as a queer space.</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>Me </span>I think I’ve only actually christened it once officially as a queer space. Pussybaby, how about you?</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>PB</span> I did a piece in New Orleans at a coffee shop. We took over this installation space, and I had thirty Barbies I ripped apart and painted all pink and blue, a Barbie house, and I really went in on the whole trans restroom in a visual assault­­pink and blue in your face. Something I’m very passionate about is that I don’t feel comfortable using the restroom in most places, and that was a really good venue to perform that piece. It was tucked away, and no one knew the restroom was made into a girl’s restroom. It was a common space that people wouldn’t think about. We spent a couple days hand painting everything. I wish I had photos because it changed my own perspective and other people’s perspective­­--changing it from black and white to pink and blue. I got jumped right before I left New Orleans, and all those photos were on my iPad. Living in New Orleans is very hard as a trans person. I literally have to have everything I love and own with me. This is the first time we’ve had an actual photographer to document the memory. Usually you blink your eye and it’s gone.</p>
    <p class="question">Does it feel like a weird representation of your own struggles in just existing as you are?</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>PB</span> TOTALLY! I’ve been thinking about why it’s so hard for people who love us and our work, but they don’t give us permanent validation. I see other artists get it and documentation,and I just don’t have that. It’s like, “I did it and it’s somewhere in the universe.”</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>T.M.</span>My existence makes people feel uncomfortable, like all the time, everywhere. It’s hard to get people on board. Even, the people I thought were my close friends, whom I made a lot of art with in Asheville. As my gender presentation became more femme, they casually­­ became disrespectful, I felt them move away from supporting me because my art became more and more confrontational to their comfort zone. I was literally the only representation of this marginalized population and its oppression. If they could ignore me, then they could ignore all of us.</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>Me</span>That’s terrible.</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>T.M.</span> Like when my art began to draw on my identity as a trans femme, it was in direct opposition to the system of power and control these straight white men were driving on, and they just didn’t want to look at it anymore. It brought into question their identity and what they were working on­­ that it was hollow of anything substantial but self­gratification. It was in the burner community too. I was very randomly placed in this community.</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>Me</span> They broke the one rule of art appreciation in my opinion. Art is supposed to move you, unsettle or shake your boundaries.</p>
    <p class="question">So you said you’re heading back to the Sanctuary after this?</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>PB</span> We’re just heading back into the woods to regroup and try to process what’s happened in the last two weeks. Rest and not worry about walking into a gas station restroom and being assaulted. I’m tired of silly stares.</p>
    <p class="question">Considering future projects here. Are you gonna continue with the Princess theme to your aesthetics?</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>PB</span> Part of our aesthetic and lifestyle is helping people process what they were told as a child is not okay. Like reality deprogramming: it’s okay for a boy to like the color pink and girl to like the color blue. Growing up, I was never allowed to watch anything with magic, and Disney was the devil, and now I’m infatuated with Disney. There’s this twisted view about how we’re obsessed with Barbie and Cinderella and a world that we and lot of other people weren’t allowed to explore, and I feel that’s part of why our work makes a lot of people feel uncomfortable. They ask, “Why are you obsessed with kids stuff? Don’t you wanna grow up?” But they don’t see from a trans perspective.Take Caitlyn Jenner. Despite her physical age, she’s probably one of the youngest trans girls because she’s just transitioned. In a similar vein, we’re living our childhood again.</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>T.M.</span> Yeah, we didn’t get to live the childhood we deserved, and we’ve both had pretty hard lives. We’re trying to get back to that innocence, but with what we’ve been through, it’s tainted. It’s not the same, and I think that’s what disturbs people--they can feel the suffering of children and the suffering of something that is ‘other’ than children--it’s all about trying to get back that innocence and forcing the person to look at it long enough to find the beauty and innocence.</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>PB</span> I feel like a lot of people take that privilege of growing up with that stuff for granted. And I want to have that type of fun because I was never allowed to. I grew up in church, and I ended up not doing well in school because I was different, and I knew I was different, and I was not okay with my lot. I’d alway play with my sister’s stuff--steal her Barbies because I was never allowed to have my own. I was never allowed to do certain things. When they put me in this “gay” category--this “faggot” category--it felt like, “That’s not actually who I am. I’m a trans woman. Why should I try to be something I’m not--something you hate?” And that’s why I didn’t get to go to my sister’s wedding...It’d make them happier if I was a gay man. It makes them uncomfortable but they can “get” that. They can’t understand the girls’ clothes or the crowns--the princess stuff. They don’t get it. They can’t see it, can’t understand it--they’re so traumatized since the world can’t see it either.</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>T.M.</span> That’s part of the aesthetic in the patterns and the checkers--all the visually disruptive things in the installations. It’s reprogramming people--forcing them to look at that and see it again We’re embodying purity as hard as we can in our installations; afterwards, we have to go to the woods to decompress because it’s actually a lot of work to dress the way we do and live the lifestyle we do. We’re constantly having people think we’re revolting for it.</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>PB</span> I feel visually assaulting because people make me visually assaulting. That amps me up to make myself feel more beautiful. That’s why those skins are so incredible. I feel like myself when I put the bodysuits on. It’s like instant hormones for me; I feel more femme when I put a pattern or a new look.</p>
    <p class="question">You feel like the bodysuits wipe the slate clean--gives you a tabula rasa to put your own identity projection?</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>T.M.</span> It’s always been a spell for me. I’ve had the bodysuits for years, and I’ve done a lot of art and public appearances with them. People project onto them because there’s no face and the pattern is disruptive. You wouldn’t believe the things people say to you on the streets. It’s like they’re talking to a dog or an animal that can’t really understand them; they negate the person inside the suit because they can’t see it to understand it.</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>Me</span> It’s like Freud’s “Uncanny.” People need a face to humanize--to assign emotions and thoughts, consciousness and connection.</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>PB</span> And when you show your face in the suit, you’re totally vulnerable.</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>T.M.</span> And you’re speaking through your body when your face is covered. It’s the only way they can get cues on your intent--like a mime. As a trans person, your existence is defined through your sexuality. When your face is covered, your whole body is covered, but you’re also a naked form. It’s an example of how you’re constantly speaking to people through the lens of your sexuality because when they’re looking at you, that’s really the only thing they’re thinking about.</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>PB</span> Also, I feel that lot of trans girls have to travel because a lot of trans people don’t have housing. Look at what happened in Orlando. They misgendered a lot of those people. Especially trans women of color.</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>Me</span> The deaths have skyrocketed in these last two years!</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>T.M.</span> It’s never been this bad before...With being a Latin person--coming from Cuban culture--the message always being taught to immigrant families coming to the country is “Assimilate! Assimilate! Assimilate!” Assimilate the ideals of a male person; hence, the Latin machismo--the big cars, tattoos, sports and blah, blah, blah. I get a lot of flak from people, especially from people of color and queer people of color, for going so deep in an aesthetic that is very dominantly white. Disney has its own system of oppression, so they ask why am I using that aesthetic.</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>Me</span> To be fair, Disney carries quite the Aryan background.</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>T.M.</span> Totally. But my stance is that there isn’t a space in my own culture for this. I’ve found a safe space that says...</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>PB</span> All girls are princesses...</p>
    <p class="answers"><span>T.M.</span> I couldn’t find a space like that in the Cuban culture, and despite whatever the fuck is happening in the US right now, it’s always been the land of opportunity. I’m gonna embrace whatever aesthetic I need to embrace in order to feel femme. It’s like queering and racially queering the aesthetic of the Disney princess. Except Ariel--Ariel’s totally trans.</p>
