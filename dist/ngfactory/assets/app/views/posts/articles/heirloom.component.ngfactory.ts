Throw whichever combination on a slice of white bread, place a couple pickle chips on top, and serve with a side of ranch. The implications here are greater than one might suspect; there aren’t many steps from batter to fryer to seasoning for this chicken, so it requires consistency in perfection.

And while infrastructure and icons like the beloved pachyderm are pieces of a fragmented memory trying to be reclaimed, there are people who those memories belong to, and it’s those people who give the life of those memories breath.
