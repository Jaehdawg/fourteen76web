Heavy layered pop anthems raced along at a break neck speed that were unstoppable even as a man fell to the ground shuddering from an epileptic seizure. This caused their music to take an oddly sinister turn as bubble gum dreams of partying at a best friend\'s house smashed into the brutal realities of life. But a few moments after the man was safely taken away by paramedics (which took far too long to reach him; hopefully the response time to emergencies will improve) the audience was sucked back into the ineffable joy emoted on stage as the band\'s frontman tossed his sea foam green telecaster thirty feet in the air, caught it, and continued with the song. Showcasing their mastery of live performance, they flowed between intricate melodic and volume changes while ferociously jumping, rolling, and head banging across stage. Although the band sometimes slips into moments that are so positively optimistic they could be perceived as campy, they have an undeniable honesty that pervades their act. The five piece created an intriguing, wholly original sound that blended the emotional epic choruses of 90’s rock bands like Built to Spill with the energetic positivity of modern electronic music. These influences are reflected in the bands two vocalists: one having a quivering punk falsetto, the other a smooth polished voice. Both singers switch back and forth then link up for whaling choruses, which lends a unique lyrical quality to their music. From ripping guitar lines that pierced through the mix to dancing synth full of pop, they created a musical experience that lacked any of the traditional festival gimmicks yet was one of the most entertaining to watch.'])),

No one seemed too thrilled about White Denim aside from obviously stoned dudes in Chacos trying to grind against the abundant butts clasped in daisy duke denim. A contrived interpretation of the classic blues groove without any of the raw energetic creativity, the only high points were interesting synth refrains or guitar solos which served as reprieves from otherwise monotonous bass driven jams. Their technical skill was clear, but past the third song a distinct formula emerged of guys casually standing on stage playing major chord progressions with an instrument ever so slightly venturing into something unique then falling away. This quickly became tiresome and one by one the already small crowd meandered from the cover of the “Shed” stage preferring to melt than fall asleep.

The singer hushed out his vocals giving the sense of a barely repressed excitement full of apprehension.
