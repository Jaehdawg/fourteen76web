          ['On an unsurprisingly humid afternoon, I saunter past the courtyard in the French Quarter. Half of the painters have packed up their works for the day, but the mediums and tarot readers are still out and fanning themselves. One such tarot reader draped in garb fit for a Walt Disney gypsy asks me for aid in adjusting the umbrella shading her stand. I don\'t hesitate because tourists shouldn’t really fear much at this hour in the Quarter. The opportunistic nature of New Orleans comes out to play at later hours of the night. I relearned this lesson well the previous night and found myself weary and irritable, but I help the woman nonetheless. When the umbrella’s fixed, she thanks me, and asks if I’d care for a reading. I decline, but she wishes me a Happy Decadence and flashes an all-knowing smile before sending me on my way. My paranoia ponders on how many different ways she had courted customers for a reading. I’m still curious of that woman’s sales pitch when I meet Ruth Ex at the coffee shop. A petite frame sports a menagerie of tattoos and piercings balancing against an androgynous haircut and dark lipstick; Ruth Ex is as hungover as I am from the events of Southern Decadence, so the coffee is well appreciated. Their voice is soft and polite as Ruth Ex explains the house show approaching in four or so hours. Their voice, coupled with the jingling of the chains attached to their translucent choker, reminds me of the descriptor on their online profile--”Hard Femme.” This political state of queerness celebrates femininity and works to dismantle the heterosexist policies of the gender binary. Even at an unconscious level, artwork will always carry expressions of their creator’s anima or animus, and Ruth Ex’s Psychic Hotline is thankfully expressing their anima.'])),

I got a clunky 70\'s drum machine and some effects pedals and started making music. It felt like i had opened up a portal inside myself and all kinds of things started spilling out.

I like the way that there is a lot blurring of the experimental and conventional in electronic music. Knowing that Cosey Fanni Tutti (of Throbbing Gristle and Chris and Cosey) was stripping to Donna Summer (whose music is so innovative and underrated btw) and bringing that influence into her own work which later helped shape the sound of synth pop and techno. I love learning about how those things overlap. I had for a long time thought that techno and house music were really vapid genres meant for car commercials and bad gay clubs but learning about how they have been white washed and decontextualized over the years changed everything. The early techno music being made in Detroit by groups like Underground Resistance was fiercely political. Early house from artists like Frankie Knuckles was born in gay clubs.
