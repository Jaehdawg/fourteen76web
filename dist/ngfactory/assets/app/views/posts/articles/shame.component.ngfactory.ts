The drums and bass build a tight rhythm, which provides sonic space for the guitars to have interesting dynamics and move the song forward. Genockey, being an avid guitar player himself, and working in studios for bands like The Pixies, gave the band access to a person incredibly knowledgeable in the world of guitars. The band also had access to a myriad of vintage guitars, amplifiers, and pedals to achieve a modernized version of classic sounds. Coyle-Smith explains that for live shows, though they use a fairly stripped back set up to accommodate for their habit of thrashing around on stage.'])),

Emerging in what felt like a washing machine of human torsos, I tried my best to blindly snap photos without destroying the camera. After the show, Coyle-Smith invited me to join them for a night cap at the Old England, where they were cordially invited to take refuge by the bassist of LICE, who was clad in cowboy apparel adorned with leather tassels. It was here that the night fell into debauchery. The smoke of a jillion cigarettes lingered in a grey haze around the billiards table, where arm-wrestles and the exchange of saliva ensued. The band has managed to remain humble despite their budding stardom. With a high-speed van chase after Iggy Pop from a festival, and a performance at Pitchfork Paris already in their list accomplishments, it’ll be very interesting to see what the future holds for Shame.'])),
