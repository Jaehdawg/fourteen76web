From atop the tea party set, an Optimus Prime mask slurs bassy complaints behind glittery pink duct tape. The assault calls to mind the work of Antonin Artaud, who demanded "communion between actor and audience in a magic exorcism; gestures, sounds, unusual scenery, and lighting combine to form a language, superior to words, that can be used to subvert thought and logic and to shock the spectator into seeing the baseness of his world." In this case, Teeny Montana and Pussybaby would be likened more to priestesses than actors, for the installation work carries more spiritual importance than a simple actor with a character performance.
